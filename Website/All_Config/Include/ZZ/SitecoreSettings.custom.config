<!--

Purpose: This include file shows how to change elements in the <settings> section
of the web.config file

To enable this, rename this file so that it has a ".config" extension

Notice that when changing simple settings like this, you can typically put in the
setting directly without using "patch:attribute" like we do in the structure below.
But you can also use "patch:attribute" for clarity:
    <setting name="RequireLockBeforeEditing">
      <patch:attribute name="value">false</patch:attribute>
    </setting>
